# shell-timer

Simple shell script to keep a running timer.

## usage

Simply call `./timer` and watch it keep track of how long it has been running.

Better yet, make `./timer` part of your executable commands by aliasing it. Then you can call `timer` from anywhere in a shell to start a running timer.
